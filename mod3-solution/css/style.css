/* Since we are using Bootstrap for this assignment, instead of specifying pixel ranges,
I will define our desktop, tablet, and mobile views in terms of Bootstrap CSS class
prefixes, i.e., md, sm, and xs.

- Desktop mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap md-based classes
- Tablet mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap sm-based classes
- Mobile mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap xs-based classes */
